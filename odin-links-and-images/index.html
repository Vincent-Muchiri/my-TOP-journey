    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>Links in websites are defined by the HTML anchor tag a. The name of the link is written with the anchor tag and the actual link is defined by the attribute 'href'.
    </p>
    <p>There are two types of links:</p>
    <h3>Absolute links</h3>
    <p>Absolute links connect to web pages outside the website. They have follow the format <strong>protocol://domain/path</strong>. An example is <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">TOP About Page</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Relative links</h3>
    <p>
        A relative link connects to a different section of the webpage you are already in or a different webpage in the same website you are in. They <strong>DON'T</strong> have the protocol or domain section, just the path. An example of this is our own website's <a href="pages/about.html">About page</a>
    </p>
    
    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p>
        Images in HTML are embedded using the element tag <strong>img</strong>. The crucial attributes for images are:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>src</strong>- Defines the location of the image as either an absolute or relative link.</li>
            <li><strong>alt</strong>- Text that describes the image incase the image fails to load and for the visually impaired.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
